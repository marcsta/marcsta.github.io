										<h3>Football</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Jenkins earned a Super Bowl ring with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018, and as a rookie with the New Orleans Saints in 2010 after being originally selected by the Saints with the 14th-overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. Malcolm joined the Eagles in 2014 and lauded Pro Bowl honors with the Eagles in 2015, 2017 and most recently, in 2018. Jenkins rejoined the Saints in 2020 after six seasons with the Eagles. As a team Captain the past several years, his impact on the field has garnered multiple awards, including team leader for most solo tackles (2017, 2019), his fourth NFC Defensive Player of the Week award (2016), in his 100th career start, became and remains the only player in Eagles history to register three consecutive seasons with an INT-TD, and this past season was one of only three NFL players on the field for all of his team’s defensive snaps the entire season. Jenkins is the only NFL safety to start every game since 2014.</p>
									<p>At Ohio State University, Jenkins was a team captain and consensus All-America selection as a senior in 2008, and was honored with the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the nation’s top defensive back.</p>

										<h3>Philanthropy</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Jenkins has inspired many through his actions on and off the field through his three-time Pro Bowl honors, 2019 Walter Payton Man of the Year nomination (his third) and 2017 NFLPA Byron “Whizzer” White Award for extraordinary philanthropic and on-field performance.</p>
									<p>Aside from football, Jenkins strives to make a positive difference in the lives of youth in underserved communities through The Malcolm Jenkins Foundation, a non-profit founded by Jenkins and committed to programs, educational initiatives and scholarship opportunities&nbsp;aimed at&nbsp;building character, promoting health and wellness, and helping&nbsp;youth develop&nbsp;the skills needed to&nbsp;succeed in life and&nbsp;become&nbsp;contributing members of their communities. The Foundation is active in New Jersey, Ohio, New Orleans and Philadelphia.</p>
									<p>Jenkins also is very engaged in social issues. In February 2017, he co-founded the Players Coalition with retired NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin to organize a group of NFL players’ fight for racial and social equality. The Players Coalition, a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) non-profit, work is prioritized into three areas of focus: criminal justice reform, police/community relations and education/economic advancement for low-income communities, primarily communities of color. Jenkins has visited prisons, met with police and legislators across the country, held town halls and led players’ advocacy efforts for cash bail, re-entry and parole/probation.</p>
